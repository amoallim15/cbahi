						<h5>
							1. Registration with CBAHI
						</h5>
						<p>
							Registration with CBAHI for the purpose of accreditation is required for all eligible healthcare facilities, and is the first step towards attaining accreditation whether for hospitals or for all other accreditation programs offered by CBAHI.
						</p>
						<p>
							Hospitals are required to register by completing the Healthcare Facility Registration Form located on CBAHI’s portal. Registration is a quick, yet an important step that provides the Healthcare Accreditation Department at CBAHI with the basic information about the registering facility. A system generated auto-reply with a code number will be provided to the registering facility upon successful registration. The code number will be used for all future communication with CBAHI.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="m-b-2" id="Pathway">
						<h5>
							2. Accreditation Pathway
						</h5>
						<p>
							CBAHI is committed to its mission of promoting healthcare quality and patient safety by supporting healthcare facilities to continually comply with accreditation standards. There are several activities a healthcare facility will go through to obtain CBAHI accreditation.
						</p>
						<p>
							Upon successful registration, the following resources will be provided to hospitals seeking CBAHI accreditation:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>National Hospital Standards</li>
							<li>Hospital Accreditation Guide</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Hospital Accreditation Guide provides all required information to help the hospital prepare for the survey visits. It contains an abstract of each survey activity that includes logistical needs, session objectives and suggested participants.
						</p>
						<p>
							Each year, CBAHI decides -in accordance with its yearly operational plan- which healthcare facilities are to be enrolled in its accreditation program for that particular year. CBAHI will notify the hospital included in its yearly accreditation program by a letter of enrollment.
						</p>
						<p>
							CBAHI provides ongoing Hospital Orientation Programs (HOPs) in different locations throughout the year. Hospitals are highly encouraged to attend at one of HOPs offered by CBAHI, Although any hospital can attend, the priority goes for hospitals selected for the current year accreditation program. During these orientation sessions, standards, accreditation policies, and survey process are all explained in detail. This is a good opportunity for the hospital representatives to enquire about the intent of a standard and how it will be implemented. Dates and venues of the orientation programs will be communicated to the hospitals in a timely manner.
						</p>
						<p>
							All hospitals enrolled in accreditation are required to conduct a comprehensive self-assessment using the Self- Assessment Tool (SAT) provided by CBAHI. This tool is intended to support the hospital in assessing how close it is to a satisfactory compliance with the standards and requirements. It also gives an idea of how much preparation and time the hospital needs before it can request a survey visit. Usually, SAT is for the internal use of the healthcare facility but it might be required by CBAHI to help deciding on the preparedness of the facility prior to conducting a survey.
						</p>
						<p>
							Self-assessment is utilized by several other accreditation organizations to help them –if properly and objectively conducted- to have a better insight on the baseline situation of each hospital and provides for a common communication tool between the hospital seeking accreditation and the accrediting body. When both parties reach a compromise about the level of preparedness for a survey visit based on the self-assessment findings, a survey can be scheduled at a tentative date suitable for both.
						</p>
						<p>
							Some hospitals (especially those with no prior experience in accreditation) might opt to go for A Pre-Assessment Visit. This visit is offered by CBAHI ) subject to the availability of resources) mainly to clarify more the accreditation policies, the standards and their intent, the survey process, the applicability of the different chapters of the standards manual, and to assess more the position of the hospital by verifying the findings of the self-assessment.
						</p>
						<p>
							Upon reaching a satisfactory level of compliance with all applicable standards, a mutual agreement is made concerning the exact date of the onsite survey. Some hospitals will prefer to go for a Mock Survey but this is subject to the availability of adequate resources at CBAHI and the requirement of its operational plans. CBAHI therefore is not obliged to respond to all incoming mock survey requests. Other hospitals however may choose to go for an upfront Real Survey.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once a hospital has applied for a real survey visit and completed all the pre-survey requirements as mentioned below, the date of the visit will depend on the scheduling availability as decided by the Healthcare Accreditation Department at CBAHI. The date of the survey will be shared with the hospital. As a general rule, a minimum of seven days will be allowed for hospital notification before the survey is actually conducted. When a short notice survey is to be conducted, the hospital leadership is expected to receive the survey team and facilitate its work. Failing to do so will subject the hospital to denial of accreditation as will be explained later.
						</p>
						<p>
							In all cases, the following requirements are to be completed before CBAHI conducts a survey visit:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The hospital has to submit successfully a completed Survey Application Form, located on CBAHI’s portal.
							<li>Service Agreement has to be acknowledged and duly signed by the hospital and a copy is returned back to CBAHI.</li>
							<li>Evidence of payment of the required accreditation fees.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The maximum number of real surveys a hospital is allowed to have for achieving accreditation is two (2) attempts, within two years timeframe. Six months is the minimal time interval between two consecutive real surveys. This, however, should not be misinterpreted as an “open-ended” exercise. For the majority of hospitals previously accredited by CBAHI, the time interval between registration and achieving accreditation was 6-18 months on average. Therefore, hospitals that will eventually prove to be incapable of achieving accreditation as reasonably persuaded by CBAHI (exceeded the two years’ timeframe from the date of the first real survey without achieving accreditation or underwent two real surveys but denied accreditation) will be suspended from participating in the national accreditation program for 12-18 months and referred to the relevant authorities for further action.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="m-b-2" id="Survey">
						<h5>
							3. Survey Visit / Survey Team
						</h5>
						<p>
							To earn and maintain accreditation, a hospital must undergo an on-site survey by the CBAHI survey team. The Healthcare Accreditation Department at the central office handles all scheduling arrangements for surveys in coordination with the healthcare facility. The date of the survey visit will be determined through a mutual agreement, based on the capacity of CBAHI’s yearly operational plan and the satisfactory level of preparedness as evidenced by the findings of the self-assessment.
						</p>
						<p>
							Hospitals enrolled in the accreditation program will be notified by CBAHI to complete and submit the Survey Application Form (SAF) available on CBAHI’s portal, indicating the type of survey requested (e.g. mock or real survey). A survey notification letter will be sent to the hospital indicating the date of the survey and other relevant information. The size and the specialties of the hospital survey team members are usually fixed but this might change according to the size of the hospital and its scope of services. As mentioned before, assessing compliance is accomplished through various survey activities and methods, such as review of documents, review of medical records and personnel files, staff or patient interviews, and the findings observed during facility tour and units visits. Whatever the methodology used, CBAHI survey is structured to be an intelligent search for areas of nonconformance to the standards, rather than a check-list exercise. As a general rule, the hospital survey team is composed of seven (7) healthcare professionals:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The Core team, composed of three surveyors: administrator, nurse, and physician.</li>
							<li>The Specialty Team, composed of four surveyors: Pharmacist, Infection Control specialist, Laboratory specialist, and facility management and safety specialist.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The survey is conducted under the leadership of a Survey Team Leader (Lead Surveyor) that has been designated by CBAHI. The team leader is responsible for assuring that all survey activities are completed within the specified time frames and according to CBAHI’s policies and survey protocols. The hospital under surveying is required to facilitate the work of the survey team members and to allow the survey team leader to practice his role and responsibilities which include:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Preparation and communication of the survey plan to the hospital.</li>
							<li>Chairing the opening and closing meetings.</li>
							<li>Communicating with hospital leadership regarding survey progress and initial findings.</li>
							<li>Evaluating team progress and adjusting survey plans as needed.</li>
							<li>Coordination and preparation of the survey report and submission of report to CBAHI central office.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Further details about the survey team and dynamics of the survey visit can be found in the Hospital Accreditation Guide provided to all hospitals upon successful registration.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="m-b-2" id="Rescheduling">
						<h5>
							4. Rescheduling / Postponement of Surveys
						</h5>
						<p>
							Hospitals scheduled for surveys are strongly encouraged to adhere to the survey date proposed by the Healthcare Accreditation Departmentat CBAHI. However, rescheduling or postponement may be considered for review, at the discretion of CBAHI and on a case by case basis, only upon:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A rationale for postponement that is acceptable to CBAHI (e.g. events that will hinder the flow of the survey process such as changes in the management team/leadership of the hospital, natural or other disasters, or relocation of the hospital to another building).</li>
							<li>At least (30) days advance notice (an official letter from the hospital chief executive officer indicating the reason(s) for postponement).</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Occasionally, requests for postponement (or cancellation of the survey visit) that meet the above conditions are accepted with no penalties, and another more realistic date is selected and agreed on with the hospital, provided this does not happen more than once during one accreditation cycle. However, requests for postponement or cancellation that do not meet the above conditions are subject to rejection (and the survey is to be conducted) or a “penalty charge” equal to (25%) of the required survey fee.
						</p><
					</div>

					<div class="m-b-2" id="Accreditation">
						<h5>
							5. Accreditation Decision Rules
						</h5>
						<p>
							As a general rule, the hospital has to meet all applicable standards at an acceptable level to become accredited. CBAHI utilizes a multilevel process for making accreditation and reaccreditation decisions. This is to ensure fairness, consistency, objectivity, and accuracy. Towards this goal, CBAHI benefits from any relevant report and/ or significant findings or issues of concern related to the surveyed facility that were brought to attention from relevant health authorities, past accreditation surveys, and other credible sources.
						</p>
						<p>
							Accreditation decisions are released and communicated to the hospital within (30) days after the conclusion of the survey visit. Accreditation decision making process is basically based on:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The findings of the survey team members as recorded in the survey report.</li>
							<li>Discussions regarding the survey findings between the surveyor and the specialty team leader (STL).</li>
							<li>Review of the draft report by the participating hospital for feedback or correction of any issues of fact before making the accreditation decision.</li>
							<li>Review/discussion during the meeting of the Accreditation Decision Committee (ADC). This committee may request additional evidence(s) before it can make a final recommendation for an accreditation decision. All accreditation decisions are then ratified by CBAHI Director General.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							It is important to note here that the decision to grant accreditation or not is primarily based on the findings of the on-site survey as recorded by the surveyors in the survey report. However, the numerical overall score that the hospital attains is one important factor among others upon which the members of the Accreditation Decision Committee rely for making their recommendation. Other factors are:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Criticality of the non-compliant standard(s), i.e. the degree of severity and immediacy of risk to patients, visitors or staff safety.</li>
							<li>Any concerns regarding the compliance of the hospital with the Essential Safety Requirements (ESRs) as specified in this manual.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Criticality has several levels. The most serious of which is when the surveyor notices an immediate threat to safety or quality of care. Examples include:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Healthcare provider is entering a contact isolation room without proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Expired catheter is being used during central line insertion or other invasive procedure.</li>
							<li>Bare electrical wire is hanging down without any protection.</li>
							<li>Incompatible blood sample is sent from the operating room while the operation is in progress.</li>
							<li>A new-born is not properly identified.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							When CBAHI surveyor notices an immediate threat whether linked or not linked to the standards or the ESRs, the survey team leader will notify the hospital director and will include the findings in the survey report. Consequently, the hospital will receive a preliminary denial of accreditation until the issue is resolved through a Corrective Action Plan, and possibly a follow up focused survey for verification.
						</p>
						<p>
							It was stated before that each standard is composed of a stem statement and sub-standard(s). The sub-standard is the evidence of compliance to be scored by the surveyor during the on-site survey. Each sub-standard has an equal weight and is scored on a three point scale as follows:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>- 0 - Insufficient Compliance (Less than 50% compliance with the standard).</li>
							<li>- 1 - Partial Compliance (From 50% to less than 80% compliance with the standard).</li>
							<li>- 2 - Satisfactory Compliance (80% and more compliance with the standard).</li>
							<li>- N/A - Not Applicable.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The overall score of the hospital is calculated using the average (arithmetic mean) score of all applicable sub- standards, i.e. as the sum of all values divided by the number of values added.
						</p>
						<p>
							When one or more chapters of this manual are not applicable in a particular hospital, they are indicated by “N/A.” Non applicable chapters are not scored and are not included in either the numerator or denominator of the overall score. Full details about scoring guidelines are available in the Hospital Accreditation Guide.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Accreditation Decision Committee shall recommend one of the following accreditation decisions:
						</p>
						<h6>Accredited:</h6>
						<p>
							Accreditation will be awarded when the surveyed hospital demonstrates an overall acceptable compliance with all applicable standards at the time of the initial (or reaccreditation) on-site survey, and there are no issues of concern related to the safety of patients, staff or visitors.
						</p>
						<p>
							Accreditation will also be recommended when the healthcare facility has successfully addressed all requirements following a conditional accreditation and does not meet any rules for other accreditation decisions. The decision to grant accreditation is not always straightforward. In some cases though, the Accreditation Decision Committee may consider the need for more clarification and/or a follow up focused survey of specific standards/areas of concern or noncompliance before a consensus decision to grant accreditation can be reached. This will also give the hospital a period of time to come into acceptable compliance.
						</p>
						<p>
							Scoring Guidelines:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Overall score 85% or above and</li>
							<li>All essential safety requirements are in satisfactory compliance and</li>
							<li>No other issues of concern related to the safety of patients, visitors or staff.</li>
						</ul>
						<h6>Conditional Accreditation:</h6>
						<p>
							Conditional Accreditation is granted when the hospital demonstrates a tangible compliance with all applicable standards at the time of the on-site survey but still has not met requirements for accredited status. The hospital is required then to develop a “Standards Compliance Progress Report”, followed by a “follow up Focused Survey” if required before changing the accreditation status. The non-compliant standards may include essential safety requirements and/or other standards/issues of concern related to the safety of patients, staff or visitors.
						</p>
						<p>
							Scoring Guidelines:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Overall score 75% or above and less than 85% and/or</li>
							<li>Some of the essential safety requirements (but not exceeding 25% of them) are not in satisfactory compliance.</li>
						</ul>
						<h6>Preliminary Denial of Accreditation (PDA):</h6>
						<p>
							Preliminary Denial of Accreditation (PDA) is a stage -rather than a final accreditation decision- that precedes denial of accreditation. The aim of allowing this stage is to give some additional time for review and/or appeal before the determination to deny accreditation. It results when there is one or more of the following reasons to justify denying accreditation:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Presence of an immediate threat to the safety of patients, visitors or staff that is observed by CBAHI surveyors during the on-site survey.</li>
							<li>Significant noncompliance with the accreditation standards at the time of the on-site survey.</li>
							<li>Failure of timely submission of the post survey requirements after conditional accreditation.</li>
							<li>The hospital has received conditional accreditation and was subjected to a follow up focused survey but still could not meet the requirements for accreditation.</li>
							<li>Reasonable evidence exists of fraud, plagiarism, or falsified information related to the accreditation process. Falsification is defined as the fabrication of any information (given by verbal communication, or paper/electronic document) provided to CBAHI by an applicant or accredited healthcare facility through redrafting, additions, or deletions of a document content without proper attribution. Plagiarism is perceived by CBAHI as the deliberate use of other healthcare facility original (not common-knowledge) material without acknowledging its source. In this case, the hospital is required to respond to CBAHI by sending an official clarification letter within five working days of the communication.</li>
							<li>Refusal by the hospital to receive the survey team and conduct a survey. In this case, the hospital will receive upfront denial of accreditation and will be subject for exclusion from the national accreditation program.</li>
						</ul>
						<h6>Denial of Accreditation:</h6>
						<p>Results when a health care facility shows a significant noncompliance with the accreditation standards at the time of the on-site survey. It also results if one or more of the other reasons leading to preliminary denial of accreditation have not been resolved. When the hospital is denied accreditation, it is prohibited from participating in the accreditation program for a period of six months, unless the Director General of CBAHI, for good reason, waives all or a portion of the waiting period.</p>
						<p>
							Scoring Guidelines:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Overall score less than 75% and/or</li>
							<li>More than 25% of the essential safety requirements are not in satisfactory compliance.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<div class="m-b-2" id="Appeal">
						<h5>
							6. Appeal against Accreditation Decision.
						</h5>
						<p>
							A surveyed healthcare facility can appeal against the following accreditation outcomes:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Preliminary Denial of Accreditation (provided it is not due to failure of timely submission of the post survey requirements after granting accreditation or after conditional accreditation, or due to the facility remains conditionally accredited after a follow up focused survey).</li>
							<li>Suspension/Revocation of Accreditation.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							All appeals shall be made within maximum of (15) calendar days from receiving the official survey report, through a covering letter sent from the chief executive officer to the CBAHI Director General via registered mail/fast courier along with documentation to support argument for the appeal, and a completed Appeal Request Form (ARF) located on CBAHI’s portal. Letters sent via electronic mail or facsimile will not be considered.
						</p>
						<h6>Grounds for appeals</h6>
						<p>
							The hospital is entitled for an appeal if it is based on one or more of the following grounds:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Relevant and significant information which was available to the survey team was not considered in the making of the accreditation decision.</li>
							<li>The report of the surveyors(s) was inconsistent with the information presented to the survey team. Perceived bias of a surveyor(s).</li>
							<li>Information provided by the survey team was not duly considered in the survey report.</li>
							<li>The outcome of the appeal –if comes in favor of the appealer- will result in changing the accreditation status.</li>
							<li>Appeals that will not result in changing the status of accreditation will not be considered by CBAHI.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Upon the initial acceptance of the appeal request (only when it is shown with clear and convincing evidence that the hospital sustained one of the grounds for appeal), the prior status of the hospital, if any, shall be restored pending disposition of the appeal.The appeal request shall set forth the specific grounds for the request, and shall include a statement of the reasons for each ground, along with any other relevant statements or documents the healthcare facility desires to include. Hospitals applying for an appeal must identify the specific alleged procedural failures or the specific manner in which the decision was arbitrary or unreasonable and not based on, or consistent with, CBAHI standards and policies. After studying all relevant reports and evidences, one of the following decisions shall be made and communicated to the appealer in a timely manner:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The adverse decision is upheld, in which case the entire cost of the appeal shall be borne by the appealing facility.</li>
							<li>The healthcare facility’s appeal is upheld and denial of accreditation is modified or reversed. In this condition a full or focused re-survey may be decided. In this case, the cost of the appeal shall be borne equally by the healthcare facility and CBAHI.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<div class="m-b-2" id="Maintenance">
						<h5>
							7. Accreditation Maintenance (Post Survey Requirements)
						</h5>
						<p>
							CBAHI has redesigned its accreditation to represent a continuous process versus a once-every-three-years evaluation. Accredited healthcare facilities are required to maintain their accreditation status by showing their continued compliance with the standards and requirements of CBAHI throughout the accreditation cycle and in accordance with the specified time frames. This translates into standing and Ad Hoc requirements.
						</p>
						<h6>Standing Requirements for Accreditation Maintenance</h6>
						<b>1. Corrective Action Plan (CAP)</b>
						<p>
							When accreditation is awarded to a hospital, a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) addressing all standards that were not in satisfactory compliance during the on-site survey should be received for review and acceptance within (120) days from the date of the accreditation decision. The CAP ideally focuses on demonstrating what has been done rather than what will be done. The CAP should identify all non-compliant standards, the requirements for improvement, the corrective actions that have been taken or will be taken with dates and responsible individuals, and as applicable,the monitoring measures to ensure sustainability of the actions taken. A delay in the submission of the CAP that exceeds (30) days beyond the due date without justification might result in temporary suspension of the accreditation certificate.
						</p>
						<b>2. Standards Compliance Progress Report (SPR)</b>
						<p>
							When a hospital is conditionally accredited, it is expected to maintain this “transitional” status until fulfilling the requirements for an accredited status. Therefore, the hospital is required to address all ESRs and other standards and issues of concern that were not in satisfactory compliance during the on-site survey in a Standards Compliance Progress Report (SPR). The SPR should be received for review and acceptance by the relevant department at CBAHI within (60) days from the date of the accreditation decision. There are cases where the SPR is going to be reviewed and accreditation decision made on that basis. In other cases, the hospital compliance is going to be validated through a follow up focused survey within (30) days from the date of receiving the SPR. Successful compliance with the standards after the follow up focused survey will result in changing the conditional accreditation to accredited status. When the hospital fails to submit the SPR as required or still does not meet the conditions for accreditation after the follow up focused survey, it will enter into a Preliminary Denial stage.
						</p>
						<b>3. Midterm Self-Assessment</b>
						<p>
							Accredited hospitals are required to participate in a mid-cycle self-evaluation of standards compliance (Midterm Self-Assessment). Fifteen months from the date of accreditation awarding, the hospital should start utilizing the self-assessment tool to assist in the periodic review of its performance against the standards. The hospital then has (3) months to complete the assessment.
						</p>
						<p>
							Completion of the midterm assessment will allow the hospital to identify areas of non-compliance with the standards and therefore, to set a plan for correction of deficient areas and come into compliance before the next on-site survey.
						</p>
						<p>
							For those areas self-identified as non-compliant with CBAHI standards, the hospital will submit a Corrective Action Plan to CBAHI that includes evidence(s) to substantiate that the standard has been brought into compliance. The relevant department at CBAHI will review each hospital’s plan of action via a telephone interview and will indicate whether the action plan and timetables are acceptable to bring the standard into compliance.
						</p>
						<p>
							During the next on-site visit following submission of the mid-term assessment, the surveyor will look for the evidences of compliance/correction that the hospital provided as part of the plan of action.
						<p>
							When there is a legitimate concern about the safety and quality of services provided by an accredited hospital at the time of the mid-term assessment, CBAHI may require the hospital to undergo a mid-cycle survey, (a fee will be charged to cover costs) and to submit a plan of action for areas of non-compliance.
						</p>
						<p>
							A delay in submitting the mid-term assessment by more than (60) days from the due date without a justification acceptable to CBAHI may result in temporary suspension of accreditation, followed by revocation of accreditation if the total delay exceeds (90) days.
						</p>
						<h6>Ad Hoc Requirements for Accreditation Maintenance</h6>
						<b>1. Reporting of a sentinel event</b>
						<p>
							It is not rare to see a sentinel event occurring in an accredited facility. When it occurs, it must be reported to CBAHI within (5) working days of the internal notification of the event. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) with a risk reduction action plan must then be submitted to CBAHI within (30) working days (see more about how and why to report a sentinel event in the Policy on Sentinel Events).
						</p>
						<b>2. Notification of significant changes</b>
						<p>
							Accredited hospitals must notify CBAHI in writing about any significant structural/functional/regulatory changes that took place after the accreditation survey, no more than (30) days of the initiation/occurrence of such changes, which include, but are not limited to, the following:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The Ministry of Health has revoked the operating license and/or has mandated closure for all or part of the hospital.</li>
							<li>The hospital is not in compliance anymore with other relevant rules and regulations (e.g., Civil Defense license or license related to radiation handling and safety have been withdrawn).</li>
							<li>Hospital accreditation by other international accrediting organizations has been suspended or revoked.</li>
							<li>A new service is initiated for which CBAHI has standards and was not included in the last survey.</li>
							<li>The hospital has a new location or a new branch.</li>
							<li>Major construction/destruction/renovation work.</li>
							<li>Significant increase (or decrease) in the volume of services/bed capacity. Merge with or acquisition of an unaccredited facility.</li>
							<li>Significant change in the governance or ownership.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The impact of these changes will be evaluated by relevant departments in CBAHI and a decision for conducting a For-Purpose Survey may be warranted accordingly.
						</p>
						<p>
							A delay in notifying CBAHI of such significant changes occurring in an accredited facility by more than (60) days from the due date without a justification acceptable to CBAHI may result in temporary suspension of accreditation, followed by revocation of accreditation if the total delay exceeds (90) days.
						</p>
						<h6>Sentinel Events</h6>
						<p>
							Thousands of patients all over the world die every year because of serious incidents happening to them while receiving care inside hospitals. CBAHI and all other healthcare accreditation organizations have one purpose in common: contribute to improved quality, safety and experience of healthcare services through systems that are patient/family-centered, provide for early identification and review of near misses and reportable events, and ensure lessons are learnt so preventable adverse events are not repeated.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sentinel Events (SE) are relatively infrequent but they do occur. Simply defined, a sentinel event is any event leading to serious patient harm or death and is caused by healthcare rather than the patient’s underlying illness. By investigating sentinel events, we can identify deficiencies in healthcare systems and processes, and put actions in place to prevent recurrence.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Ministry of Health has identified the following events as must-to report events:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Unexpected death.</li>
							<li>Maternal death.</li>
							<li>Wrong patient, wrong procedure, or wrong site.</li>
							<li>Retained instrument or sponge.</li>
							<li>Medication error leading to death or major morbidity.</li>
							<li>Infant abduction or infant discharged to the wrong family.</li>
							<li>Unexpected loss of a limb or a function.</li>
							<li>Hemolytic blood transfusion reaction.</li>
							<li>Inpatient suicide.</li>
							<li>Gas embolism.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The policy of CBAHI on sentinel events calls for the following:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Open disclosure/open communication: patients and their families are entitled at all times to truthful and transparent communication and explanation of any sentinel events happening to them.</li>
							<li>A distinction has to be made, both at the hospital and the national level, between a sentinel event occurring because of a pure negligence from the healthcare practitioner or a criminal act or a deliberate unsafe act, and another sentinel event occurring because of an underlying system failure. The former is dealt with by a special process that may involve the relevant authorities. However, for sentinel events occurring due to a system failure, individual healthcare practitioners are not held accountable for system failures and a just culture prevails. CBAHI always encourages blame free non -punitive environment and it is the prime responsibility of the hospital leadership and the heads of the departments to establish this culture of openness and disclosure in their work place, otherwise “you cannot fix that which you are unaware of !”.</li>
							<li>When a reportable sentinel event occurs in a hospital accredited by CBAHI, it must be reported to CBAHI as indicated in the timeframe below. Hospitals and other healthcare facilities that are not accredited by CBAHI are encouraged -but not required- to report. Besides reporting, CBAHI may become aware of the occurrence of a sentinel event by one of CBAHI's surveyors, from the media, from a patient or a relative, from the healthcare facility's employee or through other means of communication.</li>
							<li>CBAHI is interested to know about reportable sentinel events when they occur in accredited facilities for the purpose of learning and dissemination of lessons learnt to the medical community so that to avoid any recurrence of such events in the future. Medical errors and adverse events are opportunities for education and quality improvements (educate the young and regulate the old !).</li>
							<li>Reporting must be safe. Patients, families and staff are encouraged -and should be empowered by the hospital leadership- to report any sentinel event without fear of retribution. CBAHI has zero tolerance for accredited hospitals taking disciplinary actions against a staff member who reported a sentinel event. If the disciplinary action proves to be related to reporting, this might negatively impact the accreditation status of the hospital.</li>
							<li>Starting from January 2016, hospitals accredited by CBAHI must report to CBAHI all sentinel events by filling up and submitting the Sentinel Event Reporting Form (SERF) found on CBAHI portal, within (5) working days of the internal notification of the sentinel event (the date when the relevant authority in the hospital was notified of the incident). This should be followed by a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and Risk Reduction Action Plan within (30) working days from the date of notification of the sentinel event. Root Cause Analysis is a formal process of investigation designed to identify the root causes of adverse events.</li>
							<li>CBAHI will study the sentinel event report for further action as appropriate. This includes the submission of a progress report to show the progress made in implementing the risk reduction plan and eliminating the chance of recurrence, but it might also include a validating focused survey-scheduled or unannounced- at the discretion of the relevant department at CBAHI.</li>
							<li>The final outcome of a reported sentinel event is dependent on the level of commitment demonstrated by the hospital towards studying the root cause(s) of the incident and re-designing its processes and systems to prevent future recurrence. When CBAHI is persuaded of this constructive approach of the concerned hospital in dealing with sentinel events, accreditation is usually maintained. When this is not the case, CBAHI will pursue this further to decide on the eligibility of the hospital to maintain versus suspend its accreditation until the required corrections are made. In some other situations when the validity of the accreditation certificate is less than (6) months and CBAHI is not enough persuaded of the corrections made, an early full re-accreditation survey might be warranted.</li>

						<h5>
							8. Accreditation Suspension and Revocation
						</h5>
						<p>
							CBAHI expects nothing but truth, honesty, and sincere intentions in all dealings and propositions from healthcare facilities engaged in its accreditation program. This "good faith” engagement applies continuously throughout the accreditation cycle, and the healthcare facility must ensure that it is not violated at all times. In addition, accredited hospitals are expected to keep the same momentum before and after granted accreditation. Some might argue that it is a natural tendency to “relax” after a survey visit, but it is not acceptable that the compliance with the standards drops simply because the survey is over and accreditation is awarded. If CBAHI became aware by any mean of an accredited hospital that is not in compliance with the standards, this will be verified and an appropriate action will be taken accordingly.
						</p>
						<p>
							CBAHI may receive information regarding possible violations from accredited healthcare facilities through several channels; most importantly reports of related government agencies, written or verbal complaints and media. Types of violation include, but are not limited to, the following:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>CBAHI becomes aware of the presence of an immediate threat to the safety of patients or staff in an accredited hospital.</li>
							<li>The hospital is not committed to the specified timeframes for accreditation maintenance (e.g., timely submission of corrective action plan after granting accreditation or timely submission of midterm self-assessment).</li>
							<li>The hospital failed to report a sentinel event as per the relevant policy without an acceptable justification.</li>
							<li>The hospital is committing an act of misuse (see the policy on accreditation certificate and seal), deception, or any deliberate misrepresentation of the truth (see the policy on truthfulness and ethics clause).</li>
							<li>The hospital is discouraging communication or taking disciplinary action/reprisal against patients or staff members trying to communicate directly with CBAHI for concerns about safety or quality of care.</li>
							<li>The hospital is intentionally lacking commitment towards the continuous compliance with CBAHI standards. This might represent an overweening behavior and is a strong violation of the CBAHI accreditation process.</li>
							<li>The hospital is deliberately violating any of the other accreditation policies mentioned in this manual or in other supporting documents and manuals provided by CBAHI for the purpose of accreditation.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Once CBAHI is persuaded about one or more of the aforementioned violations in an accredited hospital, it usually responds by taking one of the following actions in any order:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Issuing a letter of “At Risk of Suspension of Accreditation”. Suspension of Accreditation.</li>
							<li>Revocation of Accreditation.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							CBAHI decides the level of response to a certain violation based on several factors including the severity of the violation, its frequency, the previous accreditation history, the source of information regarding the violation, and findings and conclusion of CBAHI's enquiry. Whenever deemed necessary, a focused or a full survey might be conducted for validation before a response or action can be made. This kind of “Discretionary surveys” is always for one or more of the above causes (e.g., when concerns have been raised about an accredited hospital's continued compliance with CBAHI Standards). An accredited hospital may undergo a discretionary survey at any time, at the discretion of CBAHI, and the survey is usually unscheduled (the hospital receives 48 hours’ notice before it is conducted) or unannounced (without advance notice) depending on the seriousness and type of the violation. Again, surveys can include either all of a hospital’s services or only those areas where a serious concern may exist. Hospitals are usually charged for these surveys, regardless of the outcome, and results can affect the hospital accreditation status. If the hospital does not allow CBAHI surveyors to conduct the survey, CBAHI may change the hospital’s status to Revocation of Accreditation.
						</p>
						<p>
							It should be noted that when the hospital accreditation is suspended, the hospital can regain accreditation once the causative violation has been rectified, but suspension will not be lifted before a prohibition period of (12) months from the date of suspension.
						</p>
						<p>
							The revocation of accreditation is a more serious complication that prohibits participation in CBAHI accreditation program for minimum of (18) months from the date of revoke. In both suspension and revocation of accreditation, CBAHI will communicate the new accreditation decision with the relevant authorities and will display it on its website. The Director General of CBAHI, for good reason, can waive all or a portion of the prohibition period.

					<div class="m-b-2" id="Random">
						<h5>
							9. Random Surveys
						</h5>
						<p>
							To support CBAHI's ongoing quality assurance initiatives, an accredited hospital may be selected for a random survey from (9) to (30) months after an accreditation survey. Random surveys are unannounced. Five per cent sample of all accredited hospitals is randomly selected each year for this activity. These unannounced surveys, which are usually conducted by 2-3 surveyors but could be full surveys, are a means by which CBAHI can evaluate the consistency and quality of its program, while also demonstrating to the public and regulators that accredited hospitals remain committed to CBAHI standards throughout the accreditation cycle. Random surveys also provide CBAHI and its surveyors with opportunities to further consult with accredited hospitals in the interval between regular surveys. No fee shall be charged to the hospital when a random survey is conducted.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div class="m-b-2" id="Certificate">
						<h5>
							10. Accreditation Certificate and Seal
						</h5>
						<p>
							Once accreditation is granted, healthcare facilities are encouraged to display CBAHI logo, accreditation certificate and seal on the facility bulletin boards, banners, website, newsletters, brochures, and headed stationery denoting their accreditation status.
						</p>
						<p>
							CBAHI requires all accredited healthcare facilities to follow the guidelines and conditions for the appropriate use of the CBAHI logo, accreditation certificate and seal. Specifically, CBAHI works to ensure that no accreditation material be used in a way which may mislead the public or others or provide false information related to the accreditation status of a healthcare facility.
						</p>
						<p>
							Upon receiving the certificate package, accredited hospitals are required to sign and return back a disclaimer/ guidelines form related to the conditions of display and publication of CBAHI logo, accreditation certificate and seal, which include:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Ensuring that printing of the accreditation seal is accurate and legible with no degradation or distortion.</li>
							<li>The size of CBAHI logo and its accreditation seal should remain in the same permitted proportion as provided. The CBAHI logo, certificate, and seal should be used in the same format, with avoidance of adding any extra graphics or words.</li>
							<li>The hospital abides by the same colors used in CBAHI logo or black and white, when being used for certain printed materials such as newspaper advertisements, newsletters, brochures, flyers and posters.</li>
							<li>The hospital is prohibited from the use of CBAHI logo or accreditation seal on business cards.</li>
							<li>Upon expiry of the certificate validity period, or suspension/revocation of the accreditation, the hospital shall immediately take actions within maximum of (30) days to refrain from using the CBAHI logo, accreditation certificate and seal. Failure to comply with the specified time frame might subject the hospital to the appropriate decision according to the policy on accreditation suspension and revocation.</li>
						</ul>

					<div class="m-b-2" id="Confidential">
						<h5>
							11. Release of Accreditation-Related Confidential Information
						</h5>
						<p>
							CBAHI acknowledges that hospitals undergoing its accreditation survey are expected to provide access to information related to the evaluation of their conformance to the CBAHI standards.
						</p>
						<p>
							As a guiding policy, CBAHI commits to healthcare facilities engaged in its different accreditation programs that all information obtained or received during the accreditation process will be kept confidential, including all survey data and information that surveyors come across during the survey process.
						</p>
						<p>
							For a hospital that is a participating member of the CBAHI accreditation program, some information is subject to public release, which includes:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The hospital accreditation status being posted on CBAHI website.</li>
							<li>The areas of the hospital which were included in the accreditation survey. The standards under which the accreditation survey was conducted.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Other accreditation-related information is not subject to public release except to the hospital on question. The exception to this rule is when CBAHI receives an official request for clarification from relevant health authorities or public health agencies. Information includes:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The mock and final accreditation survey reports.</li>
							<li>Accreditation Committee minutes and agenda materials.</li>
							<li>The notification letter of the survey report to the hospital director.</li>
							<li>The accreditation certificate.</li>
							<li>The post-survey requirements including any CAPs or SPRs.</li>
							<li>The result of investigations related to a sentinel event including the root cause analysis prepared in response to that event.</li>
							<li>The result of investigations involving any falsified information provided to CBAHI by the hospital.</li>
							<li>Any other information related to compliance with CBAHI standards that is obtained from the hospital before, during, or following the accreditation survey.</li>
						</ul>

					<div class="m-b-2" id="Complaints">
						<h5>
							12. Complaints against Accredited Hospital
						</h5>
						<p>
							CBAHI is interested to collect information from a variety of sources to improve the quality and safety in all accredited hospitals. One of these sources is complaints from patients, their families, the hospital staff, government agencies, media and the public. In particular, staff members at any given hospital accredited by CBAHI must be informed that they may make a complaint directly to CBAHI without fear of retaliatory actions from their hospital.
						</p>
						<p>
							CBAHI addresses all complaints that would help identify possible noncompliance with its accreditation standards, and consequently, a possible threat to the safety of patients, staff, or public. To be more precise, CBAHI can only evaluate complaint information in terms of its relevance to compliance with its standards. Issues of personal nature or individual disputes should be dealt with by the concerned facility or the regional health authority. CBAHI also cannot follow up on complaints about hospitals that it does not accredit.
						</p>
						<p>
							When a complaint against accredited hospital is received by CBAHI, it will undergo an initial screening to decide on its relation to standards and its impact on patient safety. If it does not relate to compliance with CBAHI standards, a response of “non-relevance” will be forwarded to the complainant and will be advised to forward the complaint to the hospital leadership or the regional health authority. If the complaint relates to compliance with one or more of CBAHI standards, a specific response shall be taken accordingly. The response will depend on a risk assessment matrix to decide on the probability and severity components.We also check for other complaints about the same hospital. Broadly speaking, CBAHI will take one or both of the following responses:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>CBAHI may write to the hospital about the complaint received and the hospital is required to make available, when requested, its records of complaints and subsequent action taken.</li>
							<li>CBAHI may decide to visit the hospital to verify if there is a problem in meeting the standards that deal with the complainant’s concern. Such visits are usually unannounced and the outcome may change the accreditation decision.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							It is the policy of CBAHI not to disclose any information related to patients or complainants unless authorized to do so. Besides the information given to the complainant about the relevance of the complaint to CBAHI standards, the complainant will be provided with the following information:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The course of action taken by CBAHI regarding the complaint.</li>
							<li>Whether CBAHI has decided to take action regarding hospital’s accreditation decision following completion of the complaint investigation.</li>
							<li>To file a complaint against a hospital accredited by CBAHI, an individual can send his concern via the contact form on CBAHI website. The other way is to file the complaint directly by calling the Universal Access Number 920012512.</li>
							<li>CBAHI requires the identity of the complainer. Therefore, anonymous complaints will not be considered.</li>

						<p>
							CBAHI works to ensure the integrity and fairness of all businesses run by the employees working in the central office as well as the surveyors.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition, all healthcare facilities engaged in CBAHI accreditation process are required to refrain from any actual or potential act or behavior that might create a conflict of interest including:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Proposing any fee, remuneration, gift, or gratuity of any value to CBAHI employees or surveyors for performance of their duties or survey-related activities.</li>
